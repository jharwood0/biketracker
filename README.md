# Biketracker

This project uses express.js to serve both the API and the frontend UI.

## !Depreciated!
The purpose of this repository is to demo the source code of Biketracker at the end of iteration 2 of the thesis. A newer, rewritten code base was created during iteration 3, featured in the following repositories:
https://github.com/jharwood0/lorabike-frontend
https://github.com/jharwood0/lorabike-api
https://github.com/jharwood0/lorabike-embedded

## Installation
Run ``npm install`` to install all dependencies.

## Build
Run ``npm run build`` to execute both the API code and the ng based frontend.

## Code scaffolding
``server.js`` holds the api and also forwards ``/`` to the ng application

``/server/`` holds all routes, models, and classes for the api
``/src/`` holds all frontend content and was generated by the angular-cli.
